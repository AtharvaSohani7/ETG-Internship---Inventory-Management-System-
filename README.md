# ETG-Internship---Inventory-Management-System-
In this inventory management system, the user will be allowed to purchase products by going through a list of products depending upon the availability displayed to him/her.
After purchasing the product, a bill will be generated stating the product details and the total amount to be paid.
The products which are purchased by the user will be deducted from the list (inventory) and thus it will be updated.
Also, if new stock of products arrive, the owner of the shop can update the inventory by adding the quantity of specific products to the earlier data of products. For eg if there are 10 chocolates remaining and a stock of 50 chocolates arrive, the owner can update the inventory by adding the new 50 chocolates to the earlier 10 making it 60 chocolates available in total.
A sales data is maintained in order to calculate or maintain the no of items and the quantity of items sold in a particular day.
